# VetMy Homes

VetMy Homes is an AI-powered multi-agent system that generates unbiased home reports using public data. It already leverages CrewAI for orchestrating a “team” of specialized agents (Crime Stats, School Ratings, Geology/Hazards, Walkability/Amenities) and a CopilotKit front-end for a chatbot-style UI. 

## Features

### Backend

- [ ] CrewAI agents for Crime Stats, School Ratings, Geology/Hazards, Walkability/Amenities

#### Nice to haves:

- [ ] Use Neon DB for storage, and maybe use with pgvector for vector search.
- [ ] Little fine tuned model with OpenPipe for something?
