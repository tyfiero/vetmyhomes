# VetMy Homes

VetMy Homes is an AI-powered multi-agent system that generates unbiased home reports using public data. It already leverages CrewAI for orchestrating a “team” of specialized agents (Crime Stats, School Ratings, Geology/Hazards, Walkability/Amenities) and a CopilotKit front-end for a chatbot-style UI. 

## Features

- [ ] CopilotKit front-end for a chatbot-style UI
- [ ] Simple landing page built with Lovable/Bolt

#### Nice to haves:

- [ ] Super simple onboarding screen. A textarea or two so a user can specify what they are looking for in a home, and whats most important. This profile data is used as context for ALL of the agents.
- [ ] A simple way to specify a budget range.
